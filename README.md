# hello-world
Part of Software Engineering Lab course at FSU, reviewing GitHub fundamentals.


I am writing in this text file from the readme-edit branch.

As per the guide, I will write a bit about myself:

My name is William, but everyone calls me Steven. 

I like tacos and my controversial take is that it is called football- not soccer!
